            <h2>AS <span>FEATURED IN</span></h2>
            <p>The Planner is a team that wants to avoid customs and hope that each wedding will 
                reflect the couple's personality. The Planner's wedding planners specialize 
                in destination weddings, so the culture is the same.
                With more than a decade of experience in the field, the company's founders combined 
                the best Spanish and British capabilities in their projects to become close friends and 
                friends not only of the organizers but also of the couples they help.</p>
