                        <p>For those couples who are not sure about working with a wedding planner and need just a first push 
                            finding the perfect venue, we have a service for you. </p>
                        <p>We will arrange a first meeting to meet you and understand your needs. The team will then create a 
                            list of the perfect venues for you with all the details and information you will need to make the 
                            decision. We will visit them with you and help with the paperwork and be by your side until the 
                            perfect wedding venue is secured. </p>

                        <h3>CONSULTATION</h3>
                        <p>If you would like to plan your wedding but just need someone to advice you with a few details, our 
                            team can help. The pre-wedding photography consultation is simply a session where we both get a 
                            chance to connect with each other, learn about each other, and discuss expectations</p>
                        <p>This consultation does not have to be a formal meeting but can be more relaxed and informal. It can 
                            happen either face to face or virtually. We have different options so let's arrange a call to see how best 
                            we can help.</p>

                            discuss any questions you might have. </p>
                        <p>Most weddings include exchanging a pair of vows, giving gifts (donations, rings, symbols, flowers, 
                            money, dresses), and public declarations by an authority or officiant. We will outline the progress of 
                            a general or religious wedding and refer to the readings and music you have decided to include.</p>

                            <p>We don't have a set number of suppliers that we work with. Each couple is different and that means not all the suppliers fit all types of clients. We help our couples finding the best match for them making sure we always work with professionals that can deliver to the standards we expect of ourselves.</p>

                            <p>We always love to meet our potential clients through a video call or coffee if possible. It's super important for the both of us to get a feeling as we will be working together for over a year, so a connection with your planner is essential. We explain in detail how we work and give you tips. Here is when the spark happens and we fall in love with our future couples. </p>
